Client-Server Chat Application is a Java-based real-time messaging system.It uses Java Sockets and Multithreading to enable multiple clients to communicate simultaneously.The server listens for incoming client connections and manages message broadcasting.
Each client runs on a separate thread to ensure non-blocking communication.This project demonstrates core concepts of network programming in Java.It helps understand client-server architecture and multi-user chat handling.
Both server and client run from the command line for simplicity.Ideal for learning socket programming and threading in Java.
